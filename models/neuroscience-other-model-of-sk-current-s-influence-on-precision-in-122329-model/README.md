**Authors**: modeldb

## Description

{"value": "\" ... In numerical simulations, the availability of both Na+ and A-type K+ channels during autonomous firing were reduced when SK channels were removed, and a nearly equal reduction in Na+


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the modeldb repository.
