title: 'Neuroscience: HighFrequencyOscillationsInducedInThreeGap114735Model'
description: "{\"value\": \"Here we showed experimentally that high frequency oscillations (up to 600 Hz) were easily induced in a purely gap-junction coupled network by simple two stimuli with very short interval. It can be used to explore neural activity dynamics and compare response patterns across conditions."
