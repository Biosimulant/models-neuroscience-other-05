# Space Prompt - neuroscience-synaptic-plasticity-combo-0049

Create a scientifically coherent **neuroscience / synaptic_plasticity** comparative space using:
- Base models: neuroscience-other-homosynaptic-plasticity-in-the-tail-withdrawal-c-83472-model, neuroscience-other-inferring-connection-proximity-in-electrically-c-94321-model, neuroscience-other-interacting-synaptic-conductances-during-distort-139150-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
