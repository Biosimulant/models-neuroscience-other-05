title: 'Neuroscience: Synaptic Plasticity (COMBO_0049)'
description: "Neuroscience Synaptic Plasticity (COMBO_0049) organizes homosynaptic_pla_1, inferring_connec_2, interacting_syna_3 into a comparative simulation setup to examine how synaptic changes influence network-level outcomes. When you run it, you can compare participant trajectories through shared runtime settings and routed output streams."

scientific_context:
  question: How do synaptic changes influence network-level outcomes?
  mode: comparative
  assumptions:
  - Model implementations are used as published in their curated manifests without
    biological reinterpretation.
  - Time integration uses a shared global tick compatible with model min_dt constraints.
  - Comparative (non-causal) mode is used because full deterministic IO coverage for
    causal coupling was not satisfied.
  expected_observables:
  - Model output trajectories under shared runtime settings.
  - Cross-model agreement/divergence in key state or metric signals.
  - Relative behavior comparison without causal linkage claims.
  limitations:
  - No new biology is introduced beyond what upstream models encode.
  - Cross-model semantic matching is rule-based and may under-connect uncertain routes.

  visualization_rationale: A dedicated monitor model receives all participating model
    state streams (`state_a..state_d`) so trajectories can be compared in one place
    without claiming causal coupling when IO semantics are incomplete.
