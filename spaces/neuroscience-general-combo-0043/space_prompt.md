# Space Prompt - neuroscience-general-combo-0043

Create a scientifically coherent **neuroscience / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: neuroscience-other-lobster-stg-pyloric-network-model-with-calcium-s-144387-model, neuroscience-other-long-term-adaptation-with-power-law-dynamics-zil-125855-model, neuroscience-other-loss-of-phase-locking-in-non-weakly-coupled-inhi-118799-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
