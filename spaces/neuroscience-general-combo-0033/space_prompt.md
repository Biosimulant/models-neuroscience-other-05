# Space Prompt - neuroscience-general-combo-0033

Create a scientifically coherent **neuroscience / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: neuroscience-other-ih-levels-roles-in-bursting-and-regular-spiking-82364-model, neuroscience-other-impact-of-dendritic-size-and-topology-on-pyramid-114359-model, neuroscience-other-impact-of-fast-na-channel-inact-on-ap-threshold-153998-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
