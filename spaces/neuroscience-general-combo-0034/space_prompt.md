# Space Prompt - neuroscience-general-combo-0034

Create a scientifically coherent **neuroscience / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: neuroscience-other-implementation-issues-in-approximate-methods-for-93315-model, neuroscience-other-ina-and-ikv4-3-heterogeneity-in-canine-lv-myocyt-83491-model, neuroscience-other-increased-computational-accuracy-in-multi-compar-129149-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
