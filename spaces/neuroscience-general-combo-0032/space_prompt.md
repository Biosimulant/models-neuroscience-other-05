# Space Prompt - neuroscience-general-combo-0032

Create a scientifically coherent **neuroscience / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: neuroscience-other-hysteresis-in-voltage-gating-of-hcn-channels-eli-82758-model, neuroscience-other-ia-and-it-interact-to-set-first-spike-latency-mo-59479-model, neuroscience-other-iandf-recurrent-networks-with-current-or-conduct-152539-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
