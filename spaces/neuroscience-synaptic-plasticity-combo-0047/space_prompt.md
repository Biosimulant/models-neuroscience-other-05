# Space Prompt - neuroscience-synaptic-plasticity-combo-0047

Create a scientifically coherent **neuroscience / synaptic_plasticity** comparative space using:
- Base models: neuroscience-other-fast-oscillations-in-inhibitory-networks-maex-de-50392-model, neuroscience-other-fixed-point-attractor-hasselmo-et-al-1995-83517-model, neuroscience-other-frat-an-amygdala-centered-model-of-fear-conditio-142273-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
